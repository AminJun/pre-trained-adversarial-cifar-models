# Pre-trained Resnet Models (Adversarially robust) for CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 

This is an unofficial repository for adversarial training for free. 
I have to give the credit to [Mahyar Najibi](https://github.com/mahyarnajibi/FreeAdversarialTraining) for free-training part and to [ChenYaofo](https://github.com/chenyaofo/CIFAR-pretrained-models) for the resnet code.
Feel free to use these models for your research.
